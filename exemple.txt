Goal: As a user, I want to visualize the batch and the expiration date on stock movement when I register a consigned material as a loss.

Prerequisites:

1- Material record: Have a medication record as "Consigned" on the record material screen where select if the material is consigned, not consigned, or both.

2- Core Table Settings: Have a "Rule for generating supplier batch" with the medication registered (Quantity to generate = Stock / Invoice Rule = Yes / Rule for Barcode on the Material = No / Rule of the receiving inspection = Yes

3- Core Table Settings: Have a "Stock operation" (Incoming/Outgoing = Incoming / Type of operation = Purchase invoice / Consigned type = Consigned purchase with material / Consumption = Does not affect / Cost calculation = Participate in average cost / Checkbox marked = Account for consigned consumption / Allows editing / Active Status / Summary column = Purchase)

4- Core Table Settings: Have a "Invoice operation" (Stock operation = same registered on previous step / Checkbox marked = Integrates accounts receivable / It is a purchase bill / Establishment stock transfer / Active status / Date rule of the Invoice accounting = Stock update / Generation of the invoice number = Manual / Retains Service Tax = Depends existence ISS on NF / Type of electronic invoice = Not an e-Invoice / Requires purchase order = No / Requires cost center when direct stock location = Requires cost center for direct location (Tasy default)

5- Invoice: Have an Invoice with the same stock operation registered before, an Item (material = medicine) with the amount, cost center, batch, and expiration. (Right-click button > Update invoice total > Calculate invoice)

6- Stock Management: Supplier batch > Search for the medicine from the invoice > The sequence plus the check digit make the code. Example: Sequence = 288876 and Check digit = 9 so the code is 00002888769 (the zeros before are to complete the code that must have eleven digits)

7- Chemotherapy > Pharmacy > Cabin feeding: Have an item added to the cabin. (Use the code with eleven digits to add the medicine)

8- System Administration: Function parameters > Chemotherapy > Parameter 181 = Yes and Parameter 306 = Yes.

Step: Chemotherapy > Pharmacy > Cabin feeding > Select the medicine > Right click button > Settle material as loss > Hamburger menu > Functions > Stock Management > Movement > Stock movement > Filter by the medicine`;
